How to install:
Simply run 'make' to create latc compiler. 'make clean' command cleans up directories to original state.

How to use:
Run 'calc [file]' where '[file]' is the path to file, which should be compiled.

How to test:
To run tests go to folder 'lattetests' and run 'runtests.sh [foldername]', 
where '[foldername]' is the folder with tests like 'good' or 'bad'.
Output will be placed in folder 'output' under folder, which you specified previously.

Note:
Right now, there are no extensions, so only tests from 'good' and 'bad' folders work.
